# FlyTyingDatabase

This database will hold an inventory of a few different classifications, enable you to store fly-tying recipes
with instructions and (hopefully) queryable items (in which you can determine which items can fulfill the requirements 
of the recipes), and store a shopping list for the next time you go to the store! 

This is hosted within a Docker container, so you can run it through Localhost or through a Dev tunnel or through 
a service like Tailscale. This allows you to use the mobile-friendly site while you're at the store, and also have 
a desktop site to see more of the information you need.

This is very much in progress and not ready for production.
